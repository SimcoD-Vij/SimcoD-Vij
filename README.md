# Hi, I'm Vijaypargavan R S ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and Iâ€™m fascinated by the intersection of AI and Electronics.  
Right now, Iâ€™m diving deep into **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** to strengthen my problem-solving and coding foundations.  

I enjoy exploring how abstract algorithms can be turned into real, working systems â€” from intelligent models to smart devices.  
Every project is a chance to learn something new and push the boundaries of what technology can do.
